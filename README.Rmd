# Lab report #1

-   Step 12.2: Fine, did not run into any problems. Was able to copy the link properly.

-   Step 12.3: Fine for the most part, had a confusing part because I accidentally doubled the file under my own git account and not my groups. So I had to delete my previous one.

-   Step 12.4: Fine, was able to save and commit my work to git.

-   Step 12.5: Did not work at first, but had to wait so we all did not do it at the same time.

-   Step 12.6: Was able to see changes on the GitHub repo.
